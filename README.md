### Content Visibility Controls
#### Overview
The Content Visibility Controls feature provides granular control over lesson accessibility in the learning management system. This feature allows administrators to:

- Set lesson visibility status
- Define start and end dates for lesson availability
- Restrict lesson access based on user roles

#### Key Features

##### Visibility Management
- `is_visible`: Boolean flag to enable/disable lesson visibility
- `visibility_start_date`: Defines when a lesson becomes accessible
- `visibility_end_date`: Defines when a lesson becomes inaccessible

##### Role-Based Access Control
- `required_roles`: Specifies which user roles can access a lesson
- Supports multiple roles per lesson
- Prevents unauthorized access based on user role

#### Accessibility Rules
Lessons are considered accessible when ALL of the following conditions are met:
1. `is_visible` is set to `True`
2. Current time is between `visibility_start_date` and `visibility_end_date`
3. User's role is in the `required_roles` list

#### Use Cases
- Scheduled course content release
- Exam preparation materials with time-limited access
- Role-specific learning paths
- Compliance training with strict access controls

#### Implementation Details
- Implemented in `LessonModule` model
- Validation in `LessonVisibilityService`
- Comprehensive test coverage in `test_lesson_visibility.py`

#### Example Scenarios
```python
# Lesson only for students, available from Jan 1 to Feb 1
lesson.is_visible = True
lesson.visibility_start_date = datetime(2024, 1, 1)
lesson.visibility_end_date = datetime(2024, 2, 1)
lesson.required_roles = ['student']
```

#### Future Enhancements
- Notification system for upcoming lesson availability
- More granular role-based permissions
- Integration with course progression tracking
